# Detection-of-Pneumonia-Disease-using-Chest-Radiogrraph-CNN-
This project is an AI-based system that automatically detects Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on publicly available chest radiograph datasets and provides reliable classification between:  Normal Lungs  vs Pneumonia Infected Lungs. Using Flask, Gradio and FastAPI
